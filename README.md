A new rendition of the classic arcade game “Breakout” featuring 2D based gothic graphics. We aim to create a new entertaining game that will feature a new experience in playing “Breakout.” We hope our game is enjoyable to all demographics whether children or adults.  The GUI included a spinning nob to provide an authentic feel as well as paddle inputs.  All elements were calculated based on the percentage needed to occupy the screen and depending on the size of the screen they too change sizes accordingly to retain all scaling.
